# Nua - A Theme for [Ghost](http://ghost.org)

The goal for this is to stand on it's own as a theme, and also act as a boilerplate for other Ghost themes if needs be.

## Usage

If you wan't to modify this theme, you need to run `npm install && bower install` in the Nua directory.

After that just run `gulp watch` to handle your styles and JavaScript.
